# Front-End Compendia

A collection of Markdown-based notebooks providing in-depth explorations of front-end development topics. Each notebook, published as a separate repository, serves as both a reference and a learning tool. Together, these notebooks form a cohesive resource, covering a wide range of subjects from JavaScript nuances to React and TypeScript patterns.

This main repository serves as a Table of Contents, containing links to each individual notebook. Each compendium is dedicated to a single technology, exploring it comprehensively to provide deeper understanding and practical insights.

## Published Compendia

### [JavaScript Compendium](https://github.com/m-kupiec/compendium-javascript/blob/main/README.md)

This notebook delves into JavaScript from its core principles to advanced topics. Coverage includes parsing and execution, memory management, asynchronous programming, type operations, and built-in objects, offering a structured look at how JavaScript works at both the syntax and runtime levels.

### [React Compendium](https://github.com/m-kupiec/compendium-react/blob/main/README.md)

The React notebook explores best practices, component design patterns, and hooks, as well as state management and performance optimization. From basic component structuring to using the Context API and custom hooks, it provides a roadmap for building React applications.

### [TypeScript Compendium](https://github.com/m-kupiec/compendium-typescript/blob/main/README.md)

The TypeScript notebook focuses on advanced types, generics, type inference, and type utilities to deepen understanding of the TypeScript type system. It also covers integrating TypeScript into JavaScript projects, making it a helpful resource for developers transitioning to a strongly typed codebase.
